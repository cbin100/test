# totallywicked/test
I'm Watchiba,


## Introduction
This project provides a starting point which allow me to create my own 
web-based encyclopedia based on the cartoon Rick and Morty.

## Project Requirements
To get started, you'll need the following:

 - PHP
 - [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
 - git
 - Laravel 8.x
 

## Task Requirements
In order to complete this challenge, I've created an encyclopedia with required 
functionality using php in an object oriented manner and having corect MVC structure.

My solution allows the user to browse the full list of Rick and Morty characters 
in a convenient manner, as well as offer some form of search and/or filtering functionality.

To do that, I built my App which first scrapps Json data from https://rickandmortyapi.com/api.
As the Rick and Morthy's API is rate-limited, I decided to create a module that execute a quick scrapping all the Json data from https://rickandmortyapi.com/api, then use proper Laravel's MVC features. 

My solution also displays basic information for a specific character, including:

 - At least one image
 - Name
 - Species
 - Origin
 - Episodes in which they appear
 
The full demo can be found here https://rickandmortyapi.gigapelo.com/dashboard

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
